## Installation

Base uses Gulp + Webpack as it's build system. To install base for your app:

```shell
$ git clone https://git@github.com:adeperio/base.git MyApp
$ cd MyApp
$ npm install -g gulp           # Install Gulp task runner globally
$ npm install                   # Install Node.js components listed in ./package.json
```

### Config

There is a config.sample.js file in the src/server directory. Before running the server, create a config.js file from this sample file and enter your OAuth2 sign in credentials from your auth provider (clientID, clientSecret, callbackURL).

config.js is in the .gitignore list. For security reasons, DO NOT push any of your configs to a public repo.

### Database

You will also need to ensure that you have a running instance of Postgresql and correctly bootstrapped with the correct database tables. The connection string for the DB should be entered in your config.js file (e.g. postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/base).

To bootstrap the database, simply run:

```shell
$ gulp bootstrap
```

To run the application, run:

```shell
$ gulp
```

### Tests

Base has a suite of tests that runs against a test database. To run the tests, you will need to make sure you have a running instance of a test Postgres db (e.g. postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/base-test). The settings for this can be entered under the "TEST" NODE_ENV section of the config.js file.

Base uses Mocha + Chai as its test framework.

Once this is setup, run the tests by:

```shell
$ gulp test
```
