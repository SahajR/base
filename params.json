{"name":"Base","tagline":"A Starter Kit for React+Flux and Express+Postgres","body":"\r\n# Base\r\n![Alt text](https://github.com/adeperio/base/blob/master/logo.png?raw=true \"Base\")\r\n\r\nThis is a seed / scaffolding project for a web application stack with OAuth2.\r\n\r\nBuilt with ReactJS, Flux, Express, and Postgres.\r\n\r\nBase aims to scaffold out a modern web application stack, with industry standard OAuth2 user access functionality and API security, right out of the box. So you can spend more time on what matters most - building, designing and hacking out your apps.\r\n\r\n## Why\r\n\r\n[Why Base? Good question ...](/docs/overview.md)\r\n\r\n##### A starter kit and reference implementation for Facebook's ReactJS+Flux.\r\nWe love React+Flux and think you will to. Base scaffolds out React components along with related Flux actions and stores, and provides a starter framework for getting a ReactJS front-end chatting with an Express / Postgres back-end.\r\n\r\n##### Secure web application stack using OAuth2.\r\nWe wanted a starter kit that scaffolds out a standard implementation of a modern secure web application.\r\n\r\n##### A light and scalabale Web Server\r\nExpress and NodeJS provides a powerful and scalable web stack as a base, but we hope enough flexibility and freedom to use and integrate other web frameworks as preferred on top (e.g Backbone etc).\r\n\r\n##### An RDBMS Alternative\r\nMongoDB is a very popular persistent store on the web, and with many good reasons. But we thnk there are many apps out there where an RDBMs is still the most relevant choice. We chose Postgres as a fast, scalable, open source, and well supported RDBMS option.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nGulp + Webpack + React + Flux + Express + Postgres + Passportjs + Bootstrap + Jade + Mocha + Chai.\r\n\r\n1. Out of the box OAuth2 implementation.\r\n2. Sign-in, Sign-up, and Sign-out.\r\n3. API endpoint protection using Oauth2 bearer tokens.\r\n4. Sign in with Google, Facebook Twitter, or Local logins\r\n5. React+Flux Scaffolding\r\n6. React-router\r\n7. WebPack+Gulp Build system\r\n8. Postgres persistent layer\r\n9. NodeJS Express web server  \r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nBase uses Gulp + Webpack as it's build system. To install base for your app:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ git clone https://git@github.com:adeperio/base.git MyApp\r\n$ cd MyApp\r\n$ npm install -g gulp           # Install Gulp task runner globally\r\n$ npm install                   # Install Node.js components listed in ./package.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Config\r\n\r\nThere is a config.sample.js file in the src/server directory. Before running the server, create a config.js file from this sample file and enter your OAuth2 sign in credentials from your auth provider (clientID, clientSecret, callbackURL).\r\n\r\n### Database\r\n\r\nYou will also need to ensure that you have a running instance of Postgresql and correctly bootstrapped with the correct database tables. The connection string for the DB should be entered in your config.js file (e.g. postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/base).\r\n\r\nTo bootstrap the database, simply run:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ gulp bootstrap\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo run the application, run:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ gulp\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nBase has a suite of tests that runs against a test database. To run the tests, you will need to make sure you have a running instance of a test Postgres db (e.g. postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/base-test). The settings for this can be entered under the \"TEST\" NODE_ENV section of the config.js file.\r\n\r\nBase uses Mocha + Chai as its test framework.\r\n\r\nOnce this is setup, run the tests by:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ gulp test\r\n```\r\n \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
