{"name":"Base","tagline":"A Starter Kit for React+Flux and Express+Postgres","body":"## An open-source, secure, web application starter kit.\r\n\r\nBase is a seed / starter kit for a modern web application stack, scaffolded out with a baseline level of security. \r\n\r\nBuilt with **ReactJS**, **Flux**, **Express**, and **Postgres**.\r\n\r\n![Alt text](https://github.com/adeperio/base/blob/master/logo.png?raw=true \"Base\")\r\n\r\n### A starter kit and reference implementation for Facebook's ReactJS+Flux.\r\nWe love React+Flux and think you will to. Base scaffolds out React components along with related Flux actions and stores, and provides a starter framework for getting a ReactJS front-end chatting with an Express / Postgres back-end.\r\n\r\n### Secure web application stack using OAuth2.\r\nWe wanted a starter kit that scaffolds out a baseline implementation of a modern secure web application.\r\n\r\n### A light and scalabale Web Server\r\nExpress and NodeJS provides a powerful and scalable web stack as a base. Other than this, we don't impose any other framework choice on the server side.\r\n\r\n### An RDBMS Alternative\r\nMongoDB is a very popular persistent store on the web, and with many good reasons. But we thnk there are many apps out there where an RDBMs is still the most relevant choice. We chose Postgres as a fast, scalable, open source, and well supported RDBMS option.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nThe Stack:\r\n\r\nGulp + Webpack + React + Flux + Express + Postgres + Passportjs + Bootstrap + Jade + Mocha + Chai.\r\n\r\n1. React+Flux Scaffolding\r\n2. React-router\r\n3. WebPack+Gulp\r\n4. Postgres\r\n5. NodeJS Express web server  \r\n\r\nSecurity:\r\n\r\n1. PassportJS for OAuth2\r\n2. Social logins (Google and Facebook)\r\n3. HelmetJS for header protection mechanisms\r\n4. TLS/SSL By default\r\n5. XSS protections\r\n6. CSRF protections\r\n7. Secure sessions\r\n \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
