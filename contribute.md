## Adding new features

This section includes advice on how to build new features for the project & what kind of process it includes.

* Try pick a feature / bug to work on from issues that have the "Ready" label.
* If you think there is a feature that we should include in Base feel free to create an issue for it. After a quick review, we will pop it into the ready column for yourself or others to work on.
* If you find a bug, log an issue for it and assign it the bug label.
* When submitting a pull request, please include tests for the changes made. It doesn't have to be a crazy level of coverage, but it does have to cover critical sections of code. We are still working on getting more test coverage in Base. Any help in this area would help big time :)
* We are trying to make security a first class citizen in this project. If you see a security related bug would be great if you could log an issue so we can help patch it up. There is a security label in the issues so we can get visibility on what security bugs are currently open.
* Here are just a few tips on some specifics on the coding style we prefer:
1. File names use lowercase and hyphens
2. Class definitions are capitalised
3. Method, instance and variable names use lower camel case.
4. DB Table names and field names follow a lowercase / underscore naming pattern (e.g. email_address)
5. As much as possible we let the code be "self commenting". We use comments sparingly if needed, but as a general rule, if the code can't be understood on reading, then it's probably a smell to indicate that it needs a refactor.


* If you get stuck or have any questions or even just want to have a friendly chat, ping / DM me on twitter @adeperio
